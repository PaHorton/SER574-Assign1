\section{Introduction}
Agility is currently the byword of the software engineering field.
Software engineers must respond to customer requirements with speed and flexibility, and for many projects, development teams have turned to Agile methodology as the answer to these demands.
A good agile team is one that communicates, but is also responsive to, changing requirements to and from other teams.
So then, how best should these agile teams communicate with each other, and what tools are at their disposal in order to ensure efficient and accurate communication?
The focus of this paper will be to answer this question of cross-team interaction.
The section "Important Aspects" will discuss which qualities allow teams to work together successfully.
This section lists actionable qualities of a healthy team dynamic that can be incorporated into any team making use of agile processes.
The following section, "Design and Architecture", discusses the role of design and architecture in cross-team communication efforts. Specifically... *****Insert a summary of section 2 here*****
