Agile models within the field of software engineering are widely used to facilitate flexibility and ease of communication in order to solve dynamic engineering challenges.
For agile teams to succeed on a complex project, they must be able to work not only with their own members but also with other teams.
The key to collaboration in an agile setting is strong architectural planning that allows for multiple teams to contribute simultaneously.
By creating a valid architecture that allows for collaborative programming, all participants in the development are given immediate feedback.
This ultimately leads to better software products developed in a more efficient manner.
