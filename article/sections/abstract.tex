Agile models within the field of software engineering are widely used to facilitate flexibility and ease of communication in order to solve dynamic engineering challenges.
For agile teams to succeed on a complex project, they must be able to work not only with their own members but also with other teams.
This is vital for projects where changing requirements may impact multiple teams.
To support collaboration in an agile setting, strong architectural planning is required so multiple teams to contribute simultaneously.
By designing a valid architecture that allows for collaborative programming, all participants in the development are given immediate feedback.
This ultimately leads to better software products developed in a more efficient manner.
