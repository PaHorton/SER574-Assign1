\section{Introduction}
Agility is currently the byword of the software engineering field.
Software engineers must respond to customer requirements with speed and flexibility, and for many projects, development teams have turned to Agile methodology as the answer to these demands.
A good agile team is one that communicates, but is also responsive to, changing requirements to and from other teams.
Understanding the communication techniques used on best practice agile teams reveals optimal development strategies for future projects.
This work primarily focuses on cross-team interaction methodology for agile development.


The section "Important Aspects" will discuss which qualities allow teams to work together successfully.
This section lists actionable qualities of a healthy team dynamic that can be incorporated into any team making use of agile processes.
The following section, "Design and Architecture", discusses the role of design and architecture in cross-team communication efforts.
This section highlights the importance of architectural design as a tool to assist cross-team development as well as how design planning and agile can coexist.
